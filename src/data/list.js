            There is an increasing interest in using machine learning (ML) across a variety of industries like finance, education and healthcare. Working on such ML product features, however, remains a point of friction for both non-technical and technical workers who without supporting infrastructure/technical knowledge struggle to fully use their skills in the context of ML. This thesis introduces novel approaches embodied in new systems to help facilitate workers better utilize the opportunities afforded by this rapidly evolving technology. At a high level, we rephrase problems encountered while ideating for ML-related features and utilizing scientific advancements as gaps in communication between the scientific community and the industry, and develop systems to help correct for this. Specifically, in the first project IdeaLens, we explore using real-world use-cases of past ML work as boundary objects while communicating technical abilities of ML work to help non-technical designers come up with new ideas within their domain. In the second project InToResearch we describe the design of a framework to spearhead an alternate ecosystem of ML research papers catered specifically to industry audience, and explore the use of TLDRs to help them navigate and find relevant information more efficiently

            Initiating conversations with new people at work is often intimidating because of uncertainty about their interests. People worry others may reject their attempts to initiate conversation or that others may not enjoy the conversation. We introduce a new system, Nooks, built on Slack, that reduces fear of social evaluation by enabling individuals to initiate any conversation as a nookâ€”a conversation room that identifies its topic, but not its creator. Automatically convening others interested in the nook, Nooks further reduces fears of social evaluation by guaranteeing individuals in advance that others they are about to interact with are interested in the conversation. In a multi-month deployment with participants in a summer research program, Nooks provided participants with non-threatening and inclusive interaction opportunities, and ambient awareness, leading to new interactions online and offline. Our results demonstrate how intentionally designed social spaces can reduce fears of social evaluation and catalyze new workplace connections.

                In Fall 2020, I was selected in a group of 6 undergraduates to represent Carnegie Mellon in a Machine Learning Research competition(ProjectX) hosted by the University of Toronto. During this project, we worked on improving Peatland Fire Prediction using Deep Learning and proposed and developed novel models in addition to constructing a new dataset for Peatland Fires in Canada. The work was published in the ICML'21 Climate Change Workshop
                Peat fires are the largest fires on earth in terms of fuel consumption and are responsible for a significant portion of global carbon emissions. Predicting fires in the peatlands can help decision-makers and researchers monitor and prevent peat fires. Despite this, research on predicting peatland fires remains largely understudied as compared to the prediction of other forms of fires. However, peatland fires are unique among fires and therefore require datasets and architectures attuned to their particular characteristics. In this paper, we present a new dataset, PeatSet, designed specifically for the problem of peatland fire prediction. In addition, we propose several models to tackle the problem of fire prediction for the peatlands. We develop novel neural architectures for peatland fire prediction, PeatNet, and PT-Net, with a graph-based and a transformer-based architecture, respectively. Our results indicate that these new deep-learning architectures outperform a regression baseline from existing peatland research. Among all the tested models, PT-Net achieves the highest F1 score of 0.1006 and an overall accuracy of 99.84%.

The paper suggests a novel ontology based weighted ensemble architecture to improve the accuracy of current models. We created a sample  such architecture consisting of a Transformer to identify ontological cate- gories of sound sources followed by an ensemble of Wave-U-Net Models.  The finale result is taken after weighing the results based on the predicted categories. In addition, the paper introduces a novel dataset consisting of 53 categories. The new model is tested on the new datasets and better training and validation curves are obtained as compared to a single Wave-U-Net model. In addition, while this is not discussed in the paper, the architecture allows for training a model by intermixing different datasets: only models specialized for the respective sounds can be trained on the new datasets. Hence, even if the resulting dataset is imbalanced, this does not adversely effect the training procedure.",

            On one hand, Graph neural networks (GNNs), an emerging deep learning model class that can extract meaningful representations from highly expressive graph-structured data are gaining popularity for a wide ranges of applications. On the other hand, as neural net architectures get deeper and deeper, the cost running modern ML algorithms efficiently is getting higher and higher. In this work, we explore techniques to make running GNNs, specifically GCNs, on everyday CPUs more feasible. Using the Wiki-CS dataset, we both analyze past approaches to optimize this class of algorithms and also suggest novel methods to optimize on the the specific structure and purpose of GCNs. We compare these approaches on several key factors including speed, cache performance and accuracy on the results.

                The aim of the project is to see if the given audio and video sample belong to the same category. Several models for this problem were implemented each of which first creates an enCoding for the audio and video input independently, using various techniques, then maps them to the same space. We also presented a novel loss function for this problem, Multi-Similarity, which builds on Cosine-BCE with increased components in the regularized term. The code for the project was written using pytorch.
